    "- A web-based tool that you drag and drop PDFs into, and the contents of each PDF becomes a row in a spreadsheet. You click an export button and download the CSV. It would be nice if it did OCR on the text, too, wouldn't it?\n",
    "- A Gradio app where you provide the YouTube URL to a community board meeting, and the things you're interested in reporting on. You click a button and on the right-hand side you get a summary of the meeting, along with aspects you might find useful.\n",
    "- Gradio app where you drop in PDFs and it answers a single question across all of the PDFs using document-question-answering instead of an LLM\n",
    "- A web app where you paste in a story you're working on and get thoughts on the side about how you might edit it. It highlights the edits and provides the feedback in a nice comment-box-like setup.\n",
    "    - A Google docs app where you get feedback on your writing\n",
    "- A tool to help process your photos, sorting them into buckets as to whether they're photos of food, cats, or family members.\n",
    "- A chatbot that takes a folder of reporting notes, video and audio and answers questions from them\n",
    "- A Google Sheets app where you paste content into a spreadsheet and it automatically fills in a second spreadsheet (???)\n",
    "- GitHub thing. Get structured data, trigger if something is true.\n",
    "- A data visualization. idk.\n",
    "- Semantic search across documents. Given a bunch of RFK Jr. interviews on Joe Rogan, find all of the times he mentions vaccines.\n",
    "- A template for a news quiz, you drop in a list of questions and answers and images, and it turns them into a quiz. It has a preview and you can click 'download HTML' and it gives you the HTML that you can put into your CMS.\n",
    "    - It provides a template\n",
    "    - Keep the images base64-encoded\n",
